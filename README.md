this is family orginiser 
and its made to train OOP skils, 
It is not perfect, but I trying defferent tools and still trying to keep this working.
It  made for one family only.
Here you need to add family members
then you need to add activity Name Date in format 12.12 start time in format 10:00 and end time
then you can create Reservation
where you can link family member and Activity

Also in Main menu is possible to choose 13 so it will activate some objects.
